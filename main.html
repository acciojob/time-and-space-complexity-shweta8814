	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task.As a programmer, your goal shouldto reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizzing it and make it more efficient </p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a related to the amount of memory occupied by the program. For Example, if a program takes an array of size n as input, the space complexityof the program becomes O(n) </p>
