	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to describe how the running time of a program or algorithm changes as the size of the input grows. It helps us understand how quickly an algorithm will run, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. Using Big O notation, we can express this growth in a simple way, such as O(n) for linear growth, meaning the time increases directly with the size of the input, or O(n^2) for quadratic growth, meaning the time increases much faster as the input size grows. This helps us compare different algorithms and choose the most efficient one for our needs.</p>
	
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> measures how much memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of its input. It helps us understand the amount of extra storage needed as the input grows. Just like time complexity, space complexity is often expressed using Big O notation. For example, if an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the memory required increases linearly with the size of the input. If it has a space complexity of O(1), it means the memory usage remains constant regardless of input size. This allows us to evaluate how efficiently an algorithm uses memory and helps in choosing algorithms that fit within the available resources.</p>
